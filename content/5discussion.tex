\section{Discussion}
One of the less performant aspects of the project was the bluetooth connection, which was very unstable. 
We account interference in the ITU building mostly responsible for that. \todo{other reasons?}

\subsection{Result}
The system sometimes encounters bluetooth interference from other devices which
cause the system not to work properly. Moreover, the weak Wi-Fi signals made system delays when simulating the hand gestures.
