\textit{Etnographic studies of surgeons and their workflows show that issues exists.
This journal attempts to solve some of the issues discovered in these studies.
A system that supports the workflow namely avoiding the spread of bacteria via touchless interaction has been designed.
To build the system multiple areas have been investigated, areas such as hardware prototyping, machine learning and software development.
This resulted in a system with 4 tiers, one handling data collection, another handling communication, a third one doing pattern recognition and the last one for presentation.
The system has quite a high recognition rate, due to some of the design choices taken.
For detailed information refer to the respective areas within the journal.
